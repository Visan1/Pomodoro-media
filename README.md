# Introduction
This is my full stack web application Pomodoro Media. The name is not finalized, but it is a web application that allows you to create a Pomodoro session to work in, and allows you to share tips and tricks with others so that learning to learn can be a community experience, and may help understand what can improve your productivity sessions.

# Objective
To build a full stack web application that uses authentication, and to eventually allow data collection to provide insight as to what makes you the most productive. I wanted this project to help people understand how they can improve the way they learn by being able to communicate with others, share their own tips and tricks on tackling different tasks, and using that data to fully optimize how they can approach learning new things in their future.  

# Optimization
These are further optimizations I am looking to add or in the middle of implementing when there is time.

-Currently aiming to add user names beside their posts
-A better background transition sequence on the Pomodoro timer
-Adding personal Spotify or playists
-Database for users to view their most productive day, and how they set their environment that day
